## Usage

If you explore the cmdlets available with the EM Powershell Module you will see there are many but as a user you should only be executing a few. These are as follows -

**Setting Up**

- Write-EMConfiguration
- Read-EMConfiguration
- Get-EMConfiguration
- Test-EMConfiguration

**Logs Management**

- Get-EMLogs
- Clear-EMLogs
- Start-EMLogsArchive

**Processing Individual Objects**

- Start-EMProcessMailbox
- Start-EMProcessDistributionGroup

**Processing Batches**

- Start-EMProcessMailboxBatch
- Start-EMProcessDistributionGroupBatch

## Importing the Module and Setup

Run the following -

 - import-module .\ExchangeMigration.psm1

On the first run you will be presented with the following -

> EM (ExchangeMigration) Powershell Module  
> https://github.com/PietroCiaccio/ExchangeMigration  
> 25/04/2019 16:49:33  
>  
> Configuration not detected. Calling 'Write-EMConfiguration' [WARN]  
>  
> cmdlet Write-EMConfiguration at command pipeline position 1  
> Supply values for the following parameters:  
> SourceDomain:  

At this stage the configuration file (ExchangeMigration.config) has never been created. The configuration file stores the following securely -

- SourceUsername
- SourcePassword
- SourceDomain
- SourceEndPoint: This is the Exchange server you wish to use for actions in the source Exchange Organization.
- TargetUsername
- TargetPassword
- TargetDomain
- TargetEndPoint: This is the Exchange server you wish to use for actions in the target Exchange Organization.
- LogPath: Defaults to C:\Temp\EM if not set
- SourceGALSyncOU: This is the DN of the OU where GALSync objects are created in the source domain.
- TargetGALSyncOU: This is the DN of the OU where GALSync objects are created in the target domain.

It is required to create a configuration file so you have a baseline for your tasks.

After you have created the configuration file you will see the following when importing the EM powershell module.

> EM (ExchangeMigration) Powershell Module  
> https://github.com/PietroCiaccio/ExchangeMigration  
> 25/04/2019 17:22:19  
>   
> Configuration detected. [OK]  
> Configuration successfully enabled. [OK]  
>  
> Use 'Read-EMConfiguration' to review.  
> To create a new configuration use the 'Write-EMConfiguration' cmdlet.  
> To test configuration data settings use 'Test-EMConfiguraion'  


**Write-EMConfiguration** [-SourceDomain] <string> [-SourceEndPoint] <string> [-SourceGALSyncOU] <string> [-TargetDomain] <string> [-TargetEndPoint] <string> [-TargetGALSyncOU] <string> [[-LogPath] <string>]
 
This cmdlet is used to create the configuration file. This will overwrite any configuration file that exists.


**Read-EMConfiguration**

This cmdlet is used to read the configuration file.


**Get-EMConfiguration**

This cmdlet is used to display the configuration that has been loaded for the module to use. This is slightly different to Read-EMConfiguration.


**Test-EMConfiguration**

This cmdlet will test your configuration. An example result is below.

> Source credential 'domainA\userA' [OK]  
> Source domain 'domainA.net' [OK]  
> Source end point 'endpoint.domainA.net' [OK]  
> Source GAL OU 'OU=GAL,DC=DOMAINA,DC=NET' [OK]  
> Target credential 'domainB\userB' [OK]  
> Target domain 'domainB.net' [OK]  
> Target end point 'endpoint.domainB.net' [OK]  
> Target GAL OU 'OU=GAL,DC=DOMAINB,DC=NET' [OK]  

### Module Defaults

The module uses the following defaults unless overwritten by Write-EMConfiguration or parameters of other cmdlets discussed later in this document -

 - Activity = "Migrate"  
 - Mode = "LogOnly"  
 - MoveMailbox = "No"  
 - Link = $false  
 - Separate = $false  
 - LogPath = "C:\Temp\EM"  
 - Threads = 10  
 - Wait = $false  
 
## Logs Management

**Get-EMLogs** [-Identity] <string> [[-Type] <string>] [[-Ref] <string>]  [<CommonParameters>]
 
This cmdlet will get the logs for a samaccountname or batch.

**Start-EMLogsArchive**

This cmdlet will package up all the log files into a single zip with a naming convension based on the timestamp, e.g. 201905022011915.zip
 
**Clear-EMLogs**

This cmdlet will delete all logs and log archives from the logs directory.

Logging terminology -

 - GO: Start of cmdlet execution.
 - LOG: A log of information.
 - AR: Action required.
 - OK: Applied successfully or healthy state.
 - WARN: Issue detected but error action will be to continue.
 - ERR: Critical issue detected and an error has been thrown. Unable to continue. 

## Preparing Mailboxes

Please note, all user objects should have been created in the target domain before mailbox preparation is implemented.

To prepare a single mailbox you would use the following cmdlet -

**Start-EMProcessMailbox** [-Samaccountname] <string> [[-SourceCred] <pscredential>] [[-TargetCred] <pscredential>] [[-SourceDomain] <string>] [[-TargetDomain] <string>] [[-Activity] {Migrate | GALSync}] [[-Mode] {Prepare | LogOnly}] [[-MoveMailbox] {Yes | No | Suspend}] [[-SourceEndPoint] <string>] [[-TargetEndPoint] <string>] [[-Link] <bool>] [[-Separate] <bool>] [[-Wait] <bool>]  [<CommonParameters>]
 
At a minimum you must specify the *samaccountname* of the source object to be migrated.
 
The below example will provide a log only result of the mailbox in scope. Please note, the example has thrown an error because a user object in the target domain does not exist with the samaccountname of miguser1. The *migrate* activity requires a target user object to exist.
 
> PS C:\> Start-EMProcessMailbox -Samaccountname miguser1  
> 20190502104602563 MIGUSER1 MIGRATE mailbox  
> 20190502104602588 MIGUSER1 SourceDomain: DOMAINA.NET; TargetDomain: DOMAINB.NET; Activity: MIGRATE; Mo ...  
> 20190502104606856 MIGUSER1 Target not found in target domain 'DOMAINB.NET' and is required for activity 'MIGRATE' [ERR]  
> Target not found in target domain 'DOMAINB.NET' and is required for activity 'MIGRATE'  
> At C:\_work\migration\ExchangeMigration.psm1:96 char:4  
> \+             throw $comment  
> \+             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
>     + CategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (Target not foun...ivity 'MIGRATE':String) [], RuntimeException  
>     + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Target not found in target domain 'DOMAINB.NET' and is required for activity 'MIGRATE'   

The below example is the same command as above however it has completed successfully because the target user object exists. We can see that the *targettype* is null and therefore no preparation of this target has been completed at all.

> PS C:\> Start-EMProcessMailbox -Samaccountname miguser1  
> 20190502105334170 MIGUSER1 MIGRATE mailbox  
> 20190502105334184 MIGUSER1 SourceDomain: DOMAINA.NET; TargetDomain: DOMAINB.NET; Activity: MIGRATE; Mode: LOGONLY; Mo...  
> 20190502105337920 MIGUSER1 SourceType: UserMailbox; SourcePDC: ENDPOINT.DOMAINA.NET; TargetType: ; TargetPDC: MPR...  
> 20190502105337958 MIGUSER1 Source is primary. Target to be mail enabled [AR]  
> 20190502105337990 MIGUSER1 Ready 

The below example takes things further. We are now instructing the mode to *prepare* rather than *logonly*. You can see a number of actions we taken on both the source and target objects. There were also some warnings where an action couldn't be completed because a target object did not exist yet. It did complete successfully however. 

> PS C:\> Start-EMProcessMailbox -Samaccountname miguser1 -Mode Prepare  
> 20190502112256485 MIGUSER1 MIGRATE mailbox

The same command has been run again but this time it has been more successful because all user objects were present in the target domain.

## Migrating Mailboxes

***Make sure all objects are prepared before moving any mailboxes. The GAL needs to be prepared in both Exchange Organizations otherwise there may be coexistence and / or mail flow issues.***

The following command will create a move request in the target Exchange Organization but will set it to not complete. This will pre-stage the mail data in the target up to 95%. This is useful because it means only a small amount of mail data will need to be synchronised at actual migration time.

> PS C:\> Start-EMProcessMailbox -Samaccountname miguser1 -Mode Prepare -MoveMailbox Suspend  
> 20190502115843968 MIGUSER1 MIGRATE mailbox  
> 20190502115843981 MIGUSER1 SourceDomain: DOMAINA.NET; TargetDomain: DOMAINB.NET; Activity: MIGRATE; Mode: P...  
> 20190502115848443 MIGUSER1 SourceType: UserMailbox; SourcePDC: ORMNDS001.DOMAINA.NET; TargetType: Remote...  
> 20190502115848450 MIGUSER1 Primary: SOURCE  
> 20190502115857083 MIGUSER1 Creating move request. Move request state: None [AR]  
> 20190502115903127 MIGUSER1 Move request created and set to suspend. [OK]  
> 20190502115903139 MIGUSER1 Not waiting for move request to complete.  
> 20190502115903146 MIGUSER1 Ready [OK]  

The following command completes the migration. Note that this time the *wait* parameter has been set to TRUE. This means the cmdlet will wait for the mailbox to be migrated (up to 12 hours) and then will complete the post migration tasks. Also note that the *link* parameter has been set to TRUE. This will link the mailbox back to the source domain. This is useful if you need to migrate mailboxes before you can actually migrate the users to a new AD forest.
